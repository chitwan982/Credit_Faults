Leveraging Data Analytics to Identify Credit Faults and Enhance Decision-Making in Microfinance Institutions

Microfinance institutions(MFIs) play a crucial role in providing financial services to underserved communities. However, these institutions often face challenges in managing credit risk, detecting potential faults, and understanding borrower behavior. With the increasing availability of digital records and transaction data, there is an opportunity to leverage advanced data science techniques to improve operational efficiency and decision-making.


Work:-
1) Developed a pipeline in a dataset with 200k+ rows and 122 features, performing data preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature engineering. 
2) Employed SMOTE, undersampling, and custom weighting strategies to enhance model performance.
3) Designed and implemented an ensemble learning approach combining Random Forest, Logistic Regression, LightGBM, CatBoost, and an Artificial Neural Network, achieving improved prediction accuracy through soft ensemble voting and hyperparameter tuning.
